2021-08-24 23:09:36 | [Karrotz#6279] (259739180660162561) Lmao nah it's chill I don't think I need it anyway it was just something to double check I know and stuff
2021-08-24 23:09:36 | [Karrotz#6279] (259739180660162561) I mean if it's just a recap of GCSE I definitely don't need it, but there was like 0 coding in GCSE so meh
2021-08-24 23:09:36 | [Solly#9232] (537726735953952778) My teacher in GCSE that its the same content but more in depth
2021-08-24 23:09:36 | [Solly#9232] (537726735953952778) and more complicated
2021-08-24 23:09:36 | [iPirie#8558] (436876982794452992) thing about a level
2021-08-24 23:09:36 | [iPirie#8558] (436876982794452992) is you HAVE to know how to code
2021-08-24 23:09:36 | [iPirie#8558] (436876982794452992) because thats part of the course is making a program as a solution to a problem
2021-08-24 23:09:36 | [Karrotz#6279] (259739180660162561) Yea hopefully it's better than the coding coursework for GCSE that shit was boring
2021-08-24 23:09:36 | [MattSimpson#3015] (431136135578779648) yeah that sounds fun, i'll watch/attend
2021-08-24 23:09:36 | [MattSimpson#3015] (431136135578779648) itll be good to be prepared before college starts
